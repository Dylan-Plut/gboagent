# Getting Started with Cortex Agents and Slack

## Overview

I have made some modifactions to the original repo, which can be found here: https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-integrate-snowflake-cortex-agents-with-slack?_fsi=4crFxTZL 

I would highly recomend following the guide instead of using my code for anything. Most of it has been vibe coded and is sub-optimal.

Cortex Agents simplify AI-powered data interactions via a REST API, combining hybrid search and accurate SQL generation. They streamline workflows by managing context retrieval, natural language to SQL conversion, and LLM orchestration. Response quality is enhanced with in-line citations, answer abstention, and multi-message context handling. Developers benefit from a single API call integration, real-time streamed responses, and reduced latency for optimized applications.
